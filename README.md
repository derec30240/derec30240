I'm *Dr. Kee*, a student of Eight-year M.D. Program in China.

I have considered programming as a hobby since high school🏫. Because whenever I solve a real-word problem with code, it gives me a strong sense of accomplishment.

Sometimes I would like to upload bolgs or interesting projects worthy showing. Given the pressures of school and research, this would not be very frequent🥲.

- 🔭 **Working**: Flutter apps
- 🌱 **Learning**: Dart & Flutter
- 🪄 **Hobbies**: Books📚, especially old books
- ⚡ **Fun Fact**: Prefer tea🍵 to coffee☕
